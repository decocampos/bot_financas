# bot_investment
I create a bot using selenium that helps me to observe some data in stocks. With theses information I could invest better my money.

This bot use the site investing.com and put some indicators that I use to evaluate if it's the best time to invest in a company.

What this bot does is to put the indicators and take a printscreen with the companies that I want to observe. Now I can see the photos and decide which company I want to invest

For the future it'll only take printscreen of the companies that has an indicator in a specific number to have more focus to know which company is better to invest at the moment
