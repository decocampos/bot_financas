# bot_investment
Imagine if you had a personal assistant to decide with you the best options to invest in that moment? To facilitate this, I have developed a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system. By incorporating your curated list and investment thesis, it guides you towards the most favorable opportunities. Rest assured, it's not a scam. Instead, it operates on a user-centric modelâ€”you define the parameters that signal the opportune moment to buy. Following your input, it meticulously analyzes the provided stock list, presenting you with options that align with your specified parameters.
